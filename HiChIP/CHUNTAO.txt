1D Peaks
The 1D peaks were called using software MACS2, and q-value cut-off was set to 0.05

Notes for 2D loops
 loops were called by 2 methods, FitHiC and LiMACC, on 5kb-resolution HiChIP data


FitHiC is a published algorithm for calling significant loops for HiC data; LiMACC was our under development algorithm


FDR cut-off 0.05 was used for both methods.

About snapshot plot


A region of chr1: 150Mb-160Mb was plot at 50kb resolution to show a quick view of the data; the upper diagonal was the HiChIP data of olig2 (noted as control) and the lower diagonal was of H3K27Ac (noted as observed); visualization was done using software Juicebox
